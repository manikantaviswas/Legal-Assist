# 🛡️ Legal Assist – Legal Guidance

## 🔥 Inspiration

In many police stations, the absence of legal experts often leads to mistakes in filing First Information Reports (FIRs). Due to limited legal knowledge or experience, investigating officers may cite incorrect or incomplete sections and acts, which affects the quality of investigation and ultimately delays justice.

**Legal Assist** was built to solve this problem by providing instant, reliable legal suggestions through an wedsite. Our goal is to empower police officers and users with immediate access to relevant legal provisions, case laws, and landmark judgments simply by writing or speaking the incident.
