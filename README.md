# üõ°Ô∏è Legal Assist ‚Äì Legal Guidance

## üî• Inspiration

In many police stations, the absence of legal experts often leads to mistakes in filing First Information Reports (FIRs). Due to limited legal knowledge or experience, investigating officers may cite incorrect or incomplete sections and acts, which affects the quality of investigation and ultimately delays justice.

**Legal Assist** was built to solve this problem by providing instant, reliable legal suggestions through an wedsite. Our goal is to empower police officers and users with immediate access to relevant legal provisions, case laws, and landmark judgments simply by writing or speaking the incident.


## üöÄ What It Does

**Legal Assist** is a smart, Web-platform that enables:

* Input of incident details via text .
* Instant recommendation of correct legal sections and acts based on the complaint.
* Display of related **case laws** and **Session related to the case**.
* User-friendly dashboard to track previous complaints and recommendations.
*And generate a well-structured FIR that includes accurate legal sections and pertinent case laws tailored to the specifics of the incident.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

Our solution is built with a robust full-stack architecture using:

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python with Flask Framework
* **AI/NLP Engine:** Trained on legal texts to classify and match incident descriptions with relevant laws
* **Data Storage:**

  * **CSV files:** To store legal sections and case references
  * **XAMPP:** To store user data, complaint details, and FIR records for each user
* **Authentication:** Flask-Login for secure user registration and login

## üí° Overcoming the Challenges

* Training the AI to interpret diverse incident inputs and map them to accurate legal provisions
* Designing a simple, intuitive interface for users with non-technical backgrounds (like officers)
* Ensuring fast and accurate legal information retrieval even for complex case descriptions
* Implementing reliable voice input processing

* Achieved **high accuracy in legal section prediction**
* Built a **clean, responsive UI** for ease of use by police personnel
* Combined **law, technology, and accessibility** into a single platform

## üìñ What We Learned
